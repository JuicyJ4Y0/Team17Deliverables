# Introduction
## Enhancing Agricultural Efficiency with a Farm Management System
Agricultural productivity relies on efficient crop and worker management, but many farms struggle with tracking planting schedules, monitoring crop health, and managing labor effectively. Our solution, AgriSuccess Management System, is a powerful tool designed to assist farmers, supervisors, and workers in optimizing farm operations. This system provides a comprehensive range of features, including real-time monitoring of crop growth progression, worker attendance tracking, task scheduling, and yield . By integrating technology, our system ensures better decision-making, improved productivity, and sustainable agricultural practices.

# Problem Statement
The current farm management system primarily focuses on administrative tasks using MS excel for example, with limited access for farmers, making it difficult for them to manage crops efficiently and lack of real-time tracking. This results in challenges in farm operations, worker and crop management.

## The farm faces difficulties in:

1. Tracking crop growth, yield, and rotation cycles – Farmers lack an integrated system to record crop progress, soil health, and rotational schedules, leading to soil depletion and reduced productivity.

2. Assigning and monitoring worker tasks – Farm managers struggle to track worker productivity and task completion, making it hard to implement and maintain crop rotation schedules effectively.

3. Managing crop rotation schedules – Without a structured system, crops may be planted in the same fields repeatedly, depleting soil nutrients and increasing pest risks. A lack of automated recommendations for crop rotation leads to inefficient land use and lower yields.`

4. Lack of communication between farm owners and workers – Without a structured system, task assignments, performance tracking, are difficult to manage.

5. Tracking of items - Without a structured system, work tools, equipment, and other items get missing or stolen. A lack of monitoring of items results in worker not working because there are no tools.

To address these challenges, we propose an integrated Farm Management System that includes real-time tracking of crop growth, worker task management, and automated crop rotation scheduling based on soil health and previous crop cycles.

# Proposed Solution
The proposed Agricultural Management System will help farmers efficiently track crop production, crop rotation schedules, and farm operations using digital record-keeping and automation instead of AI-based decision-making. The system will improve farm productivity by offering structured data management, automated scheduling, and real-time accessibility. This is in mind that there is a stakeholder that is going to receive report of the progress of the farm management.

## 1. Crop Management

Farm workers will be able to manage crop-related activities such as planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting.

### Functions:
 * Farm workers can register crop types, planting dates, expected harvest times, and yield goals.
 * Logs irrigation schedules and fertilizer applications.
 * Keeps records of pest treatments and disease prevention methods.
 * Logs harvested quantities for better production insights.

## 2. Crop Rotation Management

Crop rotation planning is essential for soil health, pest control, and productivity. This feature will help farm workers plan and track their rotation cycles.
### Functions:
* Farm workers can assign crops to specific fields and schedule rotation cycles based on previous plantings.
* Allows input of soil test results to monitor nutrient levels over different seasons.
* Keeps historical records of crops grown in each field to prevent overuse of soil and disease buildup.
* When the farm worker tries to assign previously planted crops, they will be alerted that they need to change the current crops or plans.

## 3. Farmer & Farm Operations Management

This will help farm workers and manager to manage daily farm operations, workforce scheduling, and resource allocation.
### Functions:
* Tracks seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and tools (whether they are depleting, deteriorated or damaged)
* Assigns workers to specific tasks such as planting, watering, harvesting, and field maintenance.
* ~~Logs expenses for inputs (seeds, fertilizers) and income from sales.~~ this might not be included at the moment
* Generates simple reports on farm operations, yield, and resource use
**This kind of information and report can be oversaw and managed by the shareholders. 

Provide a webste where farmers and workers can check in and log tasks for the day.
Use manual data entry forms to record work hours, tasks completed, and any incidents or notes relevant to farm operations.

## 4. Inventory Management 

This will help in tracking any items coming in and out of the inventory.
### Functions:
* Tracks items that are being used by workers, 
* Every worker will be checking in at administrator, when they are going to take their tools.
* Tracking items that are missing while they were. 

## Benefits of the Proposed System
By transitioning from purely paper-based methods to a digital log, records become easier to update, review, and share.

A dedicated crop rotation module helps in planning rotations effectively, reducing soil nutrient depletion and improving overall yield over time.

Digital attendance and task tracking reduce administrative overhead, leading to more efficient use of human resources on the farm.

Integrating basic real-time software provides farmers with up-to-date information, helping them make manual decisions based on current conditions.

Prevention of potential theft of work tools, equipment, and items by workers who don't return them.

Shareholders are able to receive reports in real-time update rather than on a weekly or monthly bases.
