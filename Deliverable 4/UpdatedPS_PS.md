## **1.1 Updated Problem Statement**

In our initial approach, we aimed to develop a comprehensive Farm Management System encompassing all aspects of farm operationsâ€”crop management, worker scheduling, rotation planning, and resource tracking. However, this scope proved overly ambitious given our current time and resource constraints.

After re-evaluating the project and receiving feedback, we realized the importance of narrowing our focus to specific areas where digital solutions could offer immediate and measurable value. We now aim to concentrate on these interconnected areas of the farm management process:

* **Crop Rotation Management**: Addressing the lack of a structured system for planning and tracking rotation cycles, which is essential for maintaining soil health and optimizing crop yield.
* **Worker Task Management**: Improving the assignment and tracking of daily tasks performed by farm workers to ensure accountability and efficient operations.
* **Harvest Inventory Tracking**: Introducing a system to log and manage harvested crop quantities for better insight and future planning.

Currently, the farm still rely on paper-based or Excel-driven systems, which make it difficult to track crop progress, inventory, and worker performance effectively. This results in issues such as:

* **Soil degradation** due to poor rotation tracking
* **Untracked or misreported harvest yields**, affecting sales and long-term planning
* **Delayed reporting**, as papers are tangible to get missing, lost or damaged

## **1.2 Proposed Solution**

The revised Agricultural Management System will focus specifically on **Crop Rotation Management**, **Worker Task Tracking**, and **Harvest Inventory Logging**, three essential features that can better operate efficiency and sustain in the long-term.
### **User management system**

Stays the same as before, the only thing that have changed is the role of person in-charger (From Admin to Manager)

### **1. Crop Rotation Management**

We will provide a system that allows farm manager and workers to:

* Assign crops to specific fields with historical tracking 
* Prevent overuse of soil by identifying repeat crop patterns(i.e., not to plants the same crops as the last batch)
* Log soil test information to guide rotation decisions 
* Instruct the user that if The NPK ratio is to high or low, should use fertilizer or its perfect for planting.
* Receive alerts if the same crop is selected consecutively for a given field

This feature will help reduce the risk of soil nutrient depletion and increase long-term yield through better planning.

###  **2. Worker Task Management**

The system will include an interface where workers and manager can:

* Log daily tasks (e.g., daily upkeep, watering, harvesting)
* Task should be derived from the Field details (i.e., crop irrigation having intervals of 3 days, or when fertilizer is needed)
* Record task completion status and time spent.
* Assign individuals or teams to Fields.
* Generate reports on productivity of task done.

The system will enhance task accountability and allow for better usage of HR on the farm.

### **3. Harvest Inventory Management**

In order to help farm to monitor their yield, we will produce an inventory tracking system that allows users to:

* Log harvested quantities by crop name, quatity, date, and field
* Track storage status (e.g., quantity in storage)
* Track the crop health 
* Generate a reports showing yield trends;

This system will ensure that harvested crops are recorded consistently, aiding both operational decisions.
