## **1.1 Updated Problem Statement**

In our initial approach, we aimed to develop a comprehensive Farm Management System encompassing all aspects of farm operationsâ€”crop management, worker scheduling, rotation planning, and resource tracking. However, this scope proved overly ambitious given our current time and resource constraints.

After re-evaluating the project and receiving feedback, we realized the importance of narrowing our focus to specific areas where digital solutions could offer immediate and measurable value. We now aim to concentrate on one or two core aspects of the farm management process, namely:

* **Crop Rotation Management**: Addressing the lack of a structured system for planning and tracking rotation cycles, which is essential for maintaining soil health and optimizing crop yield.
* **Worker Task Management**: Improving the assignment and tracking of daily tasks performed by farm workers to ensure accountability, better productivity, and accurate reporting.

Currently, many small to medium-sized farms still rely on paper-based or Excel-driven systems, which make it difficult to track crop progress, rotation cycles, and worker performance effectively. This results in issues such as:

* **Soil degradation** due to poor rotation tracking
* **Low task transparency**, leading to inefficiencies in daily operations
* **Delayed reporting** for stakeholders who rely on timely updates to assess farm progress

Our revised problem statement focuses on solving these specific issues with a scalable and targeted solution.

## **1.2 Proposed Solution**

The revised Agricultural Management System will focus specifically on **Crop Rotation Management** and **Worker Task Tracking**, two areas critical to improving operational efficiency and long-term sustainability on the farm.

### **1. Crop Rotation Management**

We will provide a digital module that allows farm managers and workers to:

* Assign crops to specific fields with historical tracking
* Prevent overuse of soil by identifying repeat crop patterns
* Input soil test data to guide rotation decisions
* Receive alerts if the same crop is selected consecutively for a given plot

This feature will help reduce the risk of soil nutrient depletion and increase long-term yield through better planning.

### **2. Task Management**

The system will include a simple interface where farm workers and managers can:

* Log daily tasks (e.g., planting, watering, harvesting)
* Record task completion status and time spent
* Assign individuals or groups to different fields
* Generate reports on workforce activity and productivity

This module will ensure transparency and improve communication between the farm manager and workers, while also providing structured data for future planning.

### Implementation Notes

* The system will be web-based with mobile-friendly forms for daily task entry.
* Real-time updates will be limited to manual refreshes; no AI or sensor-based automation is included at this stage.
* The goal is to offer a **minimum viable product** that solves real problems without overextending development capacity.
